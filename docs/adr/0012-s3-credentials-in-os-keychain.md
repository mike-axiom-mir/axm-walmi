# ADR 0012: Store interactive S3 credentials in the OS keychain

Status: Superseded by ADR 0035

Date: 2026-08-04

## Context

S3 credentials passed as command arguments can be exposed through shell
history and process inspection. Persisting them in WALDO's configuration would
leave long-lived plaintext secrets on disk.

WALDO also needs to work unattended on machines that receive credentials from
environment variables or workload identities.

## Decision

`waldo lookaside login` prompts for an S3 access key and a non-echoed S3 secret
key. Before changing the saved login, WALDO uses the supplied credentials to
write, list, inspect, read, and delete a unique probe object beneath the
configured prefix. Only credentials that complete the round trip are stored in the
operating system's native credential vault, scoped to the configured bucket.
WALDO does not request or persist a session token.

Full credentials must not appear in WALDO configuration, command output, logs,
index manifests, or OpenWALDO BOMs. Status output may show only a redacted
access-key suffix. WALDO provides no plaintext credential-store fallback.

When no WALDO keychain login is present, the internal AWS SDK uses its standard
environment and workload-role credential chain. S3 transport does not invoke
the AWS CLI.

## Consequences

- Interactive credentials use macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or
  the Linux Secret Service through the system keyring implementation.
- `waldo lookaside logout` removes credentials for the configured bucket.
- Interactive login requires `PutObject`, `GetObject`, and `DeleteObject` on
  the configured prefix plus prefix-scoped `ListBucket` on the bucket; failed
  validation preserves any prior login.
- Different prefixes in one bucket share a login; a different bucket requires
  a separate login.
- Headless deployments can continue to use short-lived environment or role
  credentials without an interactive login.
