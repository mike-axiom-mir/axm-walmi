# Opening WALDO for collaboration

The goal is to publish WALDO early, iterate in public, and make it easy for
other people to participate. This is not a stable-release or binary-
distribution checklist.

## Minimum publication gates

1. CI runs the real formatting, vet, unit, and portable end-to-end checks.
2. The source and Git history receive a focused review for credentials,
   private material, and files that cannot be redistributed.
3. The README describes the project as early development and directs people
   to a usable contribution path.
4. Documentation distinguishes current behavior from plans and design history.
5. Security reports have a private path through `.github/SECURITY.md`.

## Collaboration setup

- Add GitHub issue and pull-request templates that ask for reproducible,
  focused changes without imposing a heavyweight process.
- Label good first issues and areas where design feedback is especially useful.
- State which maintainers can review and merge changes.
- Keep the roadmap short; track active work and proposals in public issues.
- Release changes frequently from source while interfaces are still evolving.

## Explicitly deferred

- Stable API or format guarantees beyond `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`.
- Binary packaging and distribution.
- Formal release trains, long-term support commitments, and platform support
  guarantees.
- A code of conduct.

## Legal posture confirmed by the project owner

- The existing OpenWALDO contributors, CtrlIQ, Inc., and Gregory M. Kurtzer
  copyright notices are intentional.
- Contributions use Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off, including all
  `waldo-index` commits.
- `gmkurtzer@gmail.com` is the current public contact; private security reports
  may use `gmkurtzer@gmail.com` or `gmk@ciq.com`.
- WALDO/OpenWALDO trademark ownership has not been secured. Do not make an
  ownership claim or publish trademark rules until that changes.

Any future licensing, ownership, notice, trademark, or legally consequential
governance change still requires explicit discussion with the project owner.

## Current status

- Present: Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, concise project documentation,
  package tests, passing portable end-to-end tests, cross-platform CI
  configuration, and lightweight GitHub collaboration templates.
- Corrected during this preparation: the local binary ignore rule, stale BOM
  commands in E2E tests, and the obsolete CI script path.
- A preliminary source/history scan found no common credential patterns,
  private-looking URLs, user-specific paths, or historical blobs at least
  1 MiB. The owner still needs to confirm contributor email visibility and
  redistributability assumptions.
- The initial copyright, DCO, contact, and trademark posture has been confirmed
  by the project owner.
